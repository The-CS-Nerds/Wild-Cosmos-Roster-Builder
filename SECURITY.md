# Security Policy:

WCRG[^1] only stores the necessary infomation about the user, therefore sucurity is not as paramount compared to some of my other progects (such as [Library-System](github.com/the-cs-nerds/library-system))

We aim to implement as many best practices as possible, however, and we do accept security vulnerability reporting through either issues or github's security vulnerability reporting tool.
